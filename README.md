I really just want to know how much money I've lost

But for real, the goal here is to be able to provide a service where you can see both how your trades have done versus the underlying asset you were trading against, as well as against USDT. Cause it seems that there are few good sources of this information.

If you're interested in setting this up yourself, you should update the config.py to have your name. You will also need to add API_KEY and API_SECRET with the repective api key and api secret from Binance. Oh yeah, this is Binance only for the time being.
